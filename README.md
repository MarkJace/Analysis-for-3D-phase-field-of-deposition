# Analysis-for-3D-phase-field-of-deposition

The programs aim to analyze the simulation data for phase field in the case of 3D deposition.
The file format of simulation data is .vtk.

Include:
1. to draw the height plot in vertical direction.
2. to calculate the surface roughness Ra and Rq.
3. to calculate the orientation angle.
4. to calculate the grain size in XOY slice.
